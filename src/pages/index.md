Ethan Felson has a long career bridging divides between different communities. For more than 25 years he worked in Jewish community relations helping to represent the Jewish community and building important interfaith networks, first in Connecticut and then nationally. His efforts brought together leaders from the Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Ba'hai, and other communities. He spearheaded numerous trips to Israel with religious leaders including a groundbreaking Interfaith Partners for Peace program which paired rabbis and non-Jewish clergy from cities for a one-week trip to meet with Israelis and Palestinians and study sacred texts, tour holy sites, and engage in deep and meaningful dialogue. He attended many Jewish and Christian denomination conventions, helping delegates to reach greater understanding of one another's perspectives. He has spoken hundreds of times in settings about this work - and has been published widely in journals and other periodicals as well as in chapters he wrote for several books.
